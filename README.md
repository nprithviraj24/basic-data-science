1. Data Exploration and Preparation: involves cleaning data and manipulating it for further analysis.
2. Data Representation and Transformation: Several different forms of representing data. Tabular structures in the first course, text data in the fourth course, and graph-based data in the last course.
3. Computing with Data: Pipelining and how data scientist need to be able to work with different languages for
different parts on an analysis project.

Unlike enterprise software projects, where you might use one language for
implementing all of the functionality you need.
Modern data science projects can span many different languages and
computing paradigms.
Knowing when to use the right tool for the job is an important attribute. 

4. Data Modeling: Predictive modeling, generative modeling.

5. Data visualization and Presentation: Charting, graphing, 3D visualization and interactive environments.
