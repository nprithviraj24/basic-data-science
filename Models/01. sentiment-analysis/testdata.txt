whoever is reading this right now. you are a wonderful human being. and I wish you a happy and great day  
You are such an amazing product reviewer, Marques. So many Macbook Pro reviews out there, but you still manage to have the most sensible, and balanced review.  
MagSafe was way better, and wtf Apple using lighting on the phones and iPads but sub c on the MacBooks?  
Your video quality is insane.  Great review. 
Lol you tried so hard to not say   terrible   at 933  
I don t think it was smart to exclude the SD card reader. Most cameras are still going to be using SD cards for the next couple of years.   
A little too inconvenient and a lot too expensive 
You know the MacBook Pros used to be my favorite computer and now they have gotten even more expensive and for no good reason. Like they have become like the designer clothes of computers and its a shame to me b/c I used to not mind paying for better quality but I hate to have to pay for a gimmick and and a label 
My only issue with the review was that it seemed like he tried to defend Apple\ s choice to go with all USB C ports. Like I get that it may be the future. But I thought most people buy stuff to enjoy now in the present day. Not something that won\ t really be useful until 5 years from now. If i buy a 4k TV, at least I can still watch 1080p content without an issue while also being able to enjoy 4k content when it becomes the norm in 10 years. When Apple removed the DVD/CD drive. MP3s and downloadable software was already becoming a thing. So it wasn\ t that bad of a conversion. But this is just terrible. You have to buy accessories out of the box to be able to do things like charge your phone or hook up the harddrive you most likley already own. That\ s a pain and step backwards in a way. If they would have kept 2 maybe even 1. JustUSB port then you might have an argument for cutting edge. But to eliminate a very much standard port for a plug that comes with their main   money maker   the iPhone is stupid IMO. It also makes the Macbook even more expensive because of the accessories you have to buy for it to be useful. \n  Otherwise I found the review pretty reasonable and I get why may not want to rant and maybe low key defend the USB C thing because he is one of the biggest if not THE biggest tech channel on YT and Apple is watching these people closely. You a press pass to our next event?  Want an exclusive interview with another one of our executives? Then watch how you talk about us to your over 4 million followers which may have an impact on our sales... #endrant  
That verge t-shirt, Where to buy ?  
I agree USB-C is the future... just too early to implement ONLY USB-C IMO... they lost me w/o that magsafe, no sd-slot, and semi-poor specs for the   pro   price tag.  
still cheaper than marriages 
Look how triggered all the anti Apple fanboys get 
It\ s much more fatiguing to be up here than down there   MKBHD - 2016  
not a game changer for the price, Apple need to get their head out of the clouds  
literally just about to study for my exam, thats in 4 hrs, \nThen this video pops up.  
So happy I got the 2015 book. Probably the best incarnation of the product so far. Hope my baby serves me well. 
Apple could have included at least one USB 3 andHDMI port. Jeeze. 
I have no idea who\ s asking for a thin macbook pro. It\ s a pro, it\ s not an air. It\ s about power, not portability. How many ultrabooks is Apple planning to do??? pro + Air + 12   macbook?  
150 years from now USB-F users will be laughing at how slow USB-C is when they have their transfer speeds of 300GB/s 
OMG. Marques joined The Verge. 
the touch bar is a gimmick. They should have at least kept the function keys and then added the touch bar or made the damn screen touch. 
hey Marques why do you only review Apple laptops ? what about incredible Windows machines these days ? 
Still waiting for USB type D ports 
I feel like the 2015 retina macbook pro was the last decent mac there was 
why didn\ t apple put USB-C in their new iphone 7 then? half hearted   courage  ?  
1. No sd card\n2. Wierd but useful bar \n3. Need weird adaptors \n4. Way to expensive 
who thought it was a 3D scene at 244 until his hand appeared \n\ni did lol 
Why do I feel this device would have made an awesome MacBook Air successor... 
Review sins. Obvious Apple sponsorship is obvious. Ting 
If I bought a new MacBook it would definitely be the 2015 MacBook Pro 15in because it has all the ports, MagSafe, and thunderbolt  
Sums it up pretty well for me is it worth it? Hell no Do I want one? Hell yes. Am I going to buy one? Probably.. 
why is that verge shirt distracting me so much? 
Who else is watching this video on the MacBook Pro? 
you spent so much time reviewing phones you called programs apps 
Are we going to replace microSD with usb c? No. That move was just idiotic 
Sounds to me Marques likes the new MacBook... sighs 
1057 your answer right here 
4K comments? 4K video? IYM WATCHIN 
Well considered review. Doesn\ t look as crazy biased as others though... dont understand the hate, some people just want to be triggered without a reason. He just reviewed the features and their highs and lows, and kinda bashed it saying it\ s not worth the money for the usual MBP buyer and that it\ s pretty much the same as the previous model. Type C is indeed the future, and his consideration as to what to expect from the following years and how to empower its implementation is quite rational. What do you want him to say, just   lmao this shit is not worth a crap  ? That\ s just as idiotic as apple fanboying  
i would suggest fire the designer of that laptop 
Look consider that Microsoft charges the same price for their performance base surfscebook. I bought both. The surfscebook had wifi issues on day 1. Apple already released a software fix for all the graphics issues anyway 
Good Review.  So great to see a non biased review. Recently, everyone has been in the Apple Hating Train. This review is a breath of fresh air.  
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL this is why I like you and your content. Thank you for you honesty 
My only real problem with the laptops is apple has made them more ungodly expensive than usual. $2000+ for the basic touch bar version and bear minimum specs. Yeah its gonna be a few years before a laptop like that would be worth it. 
I have that MacBook 
wanted to buy a 256 gig pro 2015 edition, but the store is offering me the new mbpro without touch bar, I mostly do programming and carry around my laptop from place to place what should I choose.  
My windows laptop Lenovo Yoga Pro 2 from a few years ago released on October 2013  came with resolution & a touch screen. The laptop has functioned beautifully... Original cost $550. \n\nFast forward 3+ years, and apple has come up with a touch....bar. The resolution is great...  2560x 1600. Price... $1,499- $2,000+.\n\nWhile some companies give you a   bang for the buck,   others give you beautiful looking things for a lot of money.  
We as species take so much for granted. Just 50 yrs ago, we never ever thought of fitting a computer in our bagpack but then we also never thought 1D would ever split.  
mkbhd is an apple fanboy......OLED STRIP simply does make sense compared to microsoft surface book.\nsurface book is dynamic \nusing keyboard shortcuts makes work more effective than a random OLED strip 
you are handsome asf, and revenge of the nerds is one of my many jams. so yeah YouTube famous or not you can get it.  
Your reviews are clearly changing. Please stay loyal to your viewers and deliver high quality and honest reviews. Some of us could actually tell that there were obvious company influences to your   personal opinions   towards the product. Also please review the Microsoft Surface Studio  
Looks Good 
Pass the dongle bro 
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saving up for this cause I really need this for school  Thanks for the review very well put through 
what happens when the touchbar gets wet... im just saying 
What accessories do you use with it? Like exactly? 
LOL at all the people hating on Marques for speaking positively about Apple. So what if he s is or is not being sponsored? Every one of these Apple haters here would do the same thing if big companies gave them free expensive products to review. Stop hatin  just because YOU are NOT Marques.
Incoming dislikes from iSheep in 3, 2, 1....  
Aluminum has many great pros Aesthetics, cooling, the feeing of rigidity - while still allowing dents at the smallest bump. All amazing features  
Soon we will be getting paper cuts from these Devices 
I really liked the video but I feel like it was lacking music... 
Still pretty good still not that good lol 
Can you make a review of the Microsoft surface book with performance base? 
I came here looking for a Big Mac. 
how many phone you have use? 
why does that look like the Verge 
touch bar... pointless 
needs magsafe and sd card slot again 
The trackpad is too big Ive never had a problem going corner to corner, now you have to move your entire arm to do so...  
as always, liked the video and youtuber, disliked the product.  
I must be the only one who loves this laptop, its thinner and almost as light as the macbook air, amazing screen, touchpad, touchbar and touch id is cool, 4 usb c ports which will make the industry move to usb c faster, keyboard is great despite it not having the same travel, amazing read and write speeds,  great speakers. \nBut No SD card is not great and the price is too high  
Hi Marques.. Could you do a video on the Surface Book with Performance base? 
Particle fall on the letter   I   at 422.\n\nAmazin\ .  
Watching this  on my new MacBook Touchbar 15     
You should check out the Shure SRH1540, there an interesting set of headphones...  
The touchbar is pretty big... I expected a banana for scale  
Atleast he is franc, he is not the average person  
The Touch Bar sounds like a very fun place to get a drink at  
No Mac is worth it.
 What I love most about marques is that he explains things in such a way that I can legit go to the Apple Store and know what I m talking about\xf0\x9f\x99\x8c\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbd I binge watch his videos   
despite all metal bodies apple still has some of the worst most flimsy hinges of all laptops 
Huawei mate 9 pro review too pleaseeee 
Does it have USB 3.0 
Your RED camera quality is amazing 
So... How do you use the F1 etc. keys now? 
So helpful and so easy to look at... 
959 - ONLY time I will ever agree with Kanye. 
it s not worth it 
We got ours for free 
rare editing error at 855... 
The verge 
Well one thing for sure, laptop isn t made for future proof. I can bear with its internal CPU + GPU especially but having limited port for the rest of its life spawn? No thank you. \n\nAnyway, this is fair review. In the end he say its not worth the money despite many pros that he like. 
423 tried to blow the dust/lint off that keyboard lol 
Its a good thing its thinner. You will need all the space you can get to carry all those dongles. 
I just got my 15 inch MacBook Pro in space grey and I love it If you have questions or arguments let me know 
Amazing review Keep up the great work
NOT WORTH IT. Get the Surface Pro. Or the Razer.... or .... Lenovo.... Touch screen is awesome... Esp. when you can run desktop programs. Cant say much for the ipad either for that reason_... uggggh 
The World s MOST HATED LAPTOP
Are we going to get a Surface Laptop review? Not all your subscribers are Mac users.  
absolute waste of money for the touch bar.  Its just so dum 
Do you mind doing a separate video for Final Cut Pro in combination with the new touch bar? 
no pro specs? get a laptop 
Those hardware specs are terrible. End of video. 
I want Apple logo to glow 
It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an sd card slot? 
That touch bar is nothing but a fancy gimmick. 
His tee shirt has the palace tri ferg logo upside down. Haha 
an sd card reader is super slim.... why not put it in? there is plenttttttyyyy of room 
I  love this laptop Specced out 
Thank you  for the review. I think there must be some justifiable reasons that Apple design this computer this way. Forward thinking is worth than present thinking. I used to think touch bar and fewer ports are not something appealing. But once I tried them I think it proves the design is improving and the reasons behind are making sense. So I move forward. 
I just wish Apple would make a keyboard for the iMac with this tech. 
I love how you get real about financial decisions and that we dont all have that sort of money to be spending on things like this if not at all 
This a great new way to bring old tech and repurpose it. The touch bar is not new tech. Samsung edge had a similar shortcut bar on the edge of the phone. It is way overpriced this falls inline with apple ideas. The iPod was introduced In a phone first. Well iTunes was. Only had like a 10 song capacity. Now almost everyone has an iPod or iPhone. Love apple computers. Hate the phone. I own the pixel XL. TO EACH HIS OR HER OWN. 
Hey @Marques could you show @Casey how to use the touch bar? After being boight by Samsung he now literally complains about every apple product. 
1056 RIP MacBook Pro 2016 sales. \xf0\x9f\x98\x9d 
What Ram and storage would you recommend getting? 
Best laptop i ever buy worth every penny and the big the mouse pad is the top reason i love this laptop to 
can someone tell me what wallpaper he is using at @131? I would like to download 
Appreciate the review man. Thankyou. 
What about the battery capacity ? What about the hard drive ? The CPU processing frequency ? All of them are relatively law compared with the market\xe2\x80\x99s new laptops. Not and honest review unfortunately. 
MKBHD with a shirt a The Verge shirt... LOL 
1. Fingerprint because its a touchscreen\n2. Its a matte finish so its ok with fingerprints \nWtf Marques? 
The MacBook Air still has a glowing one 
Very good laptop 
FYI. A consumer protection agency stated that this is the worst MacBook Pro ever and recommend it as a NO BUY, because of battery drain issues. Anyone can google this under consumer reports. Secondly, this so called Pro laptop is non upgradable after purchase. Memory and storage are soldered in the motherboard. I propose that the idea of anyone who claims that this laptop is used by and for professionals is only deceiving themselves and receiving checks from Apple to make videos.  
why are you watching this?? you are not gonna buy it anyway 
I hope next mac book apple will make the keyboard digital like a phone  and make add a usb port for you to convert your i phone into a touch pad 
 would never buy a Mac\nBut that touch bar is pretty cool 
Apple = design 
Shame on apple that it requires shareit and xender to transfer the files and dont really understand why mkbhd beg to apple for things which apple cant even satisfy. 
I wish I could afford this 
Do you recommend buying the Macbook Pro with touch bar? or without? I am a first year graphic design major student and I start school January 2018. I just wanted to know which would be the better buy? Please help. Thank you. 
Always have great review Marques thats why I subscribed to your channel and follows your videos. But only if I can afford one to buy. If you can just give awaymacbook pro. I wish to be the lucky winner. Hooray to more reviews \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 
life with bunch of dongles is never a future. 
whats the point of a touch screen laptop when u have a cursor???? 
dont like macs because i usually use dell and alienware . Bt this new  mac pro looks awesome .. thanks for reviewing this MKBHD .. i like you bro \xe2\x9c\x8c 
some people forget how simple apple is known to be and that almost anyone could use their devices. Not everyone knows all the keyboard commands and this touch bar can be very useful. BUT..... its too expensive 
CAN U PLZ  GIVE AWAY ONE FOR ME CAUSE I NEED ONE FOR MY SCHOOL WORK AND I CANT GET ONE 
i have a MacBook Pro 2017 Touch Bar got it for $350 on eBay and then went on \xe2\x80\x98Wish\xe2\x80\x99 and ordered adapters for about $17. So obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a great laptop but not for what Apple sells it for\xf0\x9f\x92\x80Just buy one on eBay You have to go on eBay everyday until you find one for great price. 
It just works -apple 2013\nIt just works provided that you have the 17 dongles needed to get to it work. -apple 2016 
I wanted a touchscreen laptop but I think you changed my mind with the MacBook Pro 
Super 
What camera you are using to film this?thank you 
the magsafe should be standard... 
who uses safari though? 
just bought full hardware spec 2015 macbookpro for a bargain price. Its still light af and good for my type of editing.

Does it contain front facing camera? 
have you or can you make another video regarding the macbook pro you are using now as a followup to this one? I am debating wether to get this mac or wait. Your videos are awesome 
Apple gonna put USB type C port on their next iPhone. 
Very informative review. Thanks. 
I love this I really want  it 
The macbook basically took away everything people liked it for. 
saying pro makes his fingers itch 
whether this laptop has touch screen window 
You type like cringe... should learn to type properly. Great overall review tho. 
Thank God now the shine is coming off and people are starting to see the MacBook pro for what it is. \nA Gimic and a bad one at that\n\nThis coming form a life long Apple user. But this time they have crossed the bridge from doing something new to ScruU and your wallet. 
Nerd. 
The handful of adapters is absurd. 
The 2016 macbook pro is super gorgeous but too bad apple ditched the light logo.. 
Damn that meta 
I want IOS devices to get USB C I love the lightning connector but the alternative is finally good enough. 
Completely honest and awesome review. Just bought the 13.3 2.9ghz model with touch bar. Its just like you said very expensive and probably not worth it but definitely a quality premium product for tech enthusiasts . 
This video was very helpful Are you not able to charge your phone through your computer anymore? 
Good review. Thanks 
2k views already
Has the thunderbolt port loosen in the macbook pro? 
This macbook only has 4 ports... then he lists 5... 
Im buying it when I get my student loans so hyped 
What about the camera 
what lens ur using for video bro??? 
why are you wearing verge logo 
You deserve a like and a subscribe from me. This is the first time watching a review and not fast forward it. Good review. 
why is the keyboard so compacted and the touchpad is so damn big 
Why dose he have the verge shirt on 
Stop looking on the top of your camera look at the lenses 
Is is just me or this guy is the best of all tech youtubers. 
I just bought the 2016 15 inch Base model for Considering the cheapest 2017 15 inch MacBook pro is 2799 that is quite a good deal 
my god that crackling sound at the beginning mad me think that my speakers were blown 
Is the battery still draining after several macOS updates? 
I wonder what a computer with a digital keyboard A screen with a keyboard where a key board should be would be like. This would be useful for custom keyboards like a FCPX or Adobe Premiere Pro Keyboard. 
Great review. Thanks. 
Yup they lost me with the usb-c only And no sd reader? Idiots lol 
Apple needs to make a external slide bar keyboards for iMacs and MacBooks who dont have them built in. 
want note 8 from the giveaway please 
Pro is clearly overprized as Marquees says it. But he can afford it because he is a $-millionaire. 
After hearing all these awful reviews idk if should get this laptop. Can anyone recommend me some different ones? 
I have a MacBook pro 
some really bad noise in first second of the video please cut first second of the video 
would you recommend the mac book pro for someone who has a brain injury and is trying to go to College to take classes 
What is the model of this laptop you have saw in video ?describe 
it is worth it r u kidding \nit is overpriced yh but  the value is definitely there so i would call that overpriced 
average minds discuss people and mkbhd discuss technology... 
I wonder if there is another laptop that is $600 cheaper but with the same hardware and has an entire touchscreen instead of just a touchbar? 
They should make the trackpad a touchscreen and get rid of the slider. 
Is thisbworth buying im a level 3 graphic design student at college? 
im buying a macbook because i am going to be film production major next year and apple is great with film editing but removing the SD card slot makes my life so much harder \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9 
They need to put 8 thunderbolt 3 ports on their 15 inch and 6 on their 13 inch MacBook pros 
Why would i even want a touch bar when i can get a touch screen? 
Verge logo tee and MacBook review
I honestly forgot this existed 
did i see your face on that spotify on your laptop? 
Nice review. This is really solid. 
love your reviewssss 
I think I made the right decision with purchasing the 2015. 
now I am sorry to take the defending side for this laptop but people seem to only care for spec per price ratio... that is maybe something gamers should care about but not the professional. 
You belong on the runway of NYFW omg youre beautiful AND you have a model face/build 
The more thiner the laptops are getting more chance of getting broken when they slip out of your hand to ground so it is a dis advantage 
0   Is this the laptop that i see in your back pack video? 
I like how you present. You have a subscription from me. 
why are the r o p n keys darker than the other keys? 
Roses are red\nViolets are blue\nMac Books are trash\nApple fanboys are cancer 
Rip MagSafe or welcome usb-C to MagSafe adapter 
Awesome It has all the stuffs i need. 
lol this thing dosent have any good accesories like a minecraft keyboard cover 
Dongle Book Pro 
Mac book pro is only thing I hate from Apple. Every thing else apple makes is good 
I just got the space grey Mac book pro 2016 with the touch bar and it is absolutely amazing and it makes everything easier and it is really easy to use.

usual little please qaeery bread begin representative bay departure portrait mom planning drift. 
can anybody provide a link or drop some bombass knowledge on whether or not Apple made the touchbar optimised for pro tools? 
With each iteration Apple cuts back on specs and increases the price.  This is the reason why most people prefer a Hackintosh then getting a actual Apple PC.

For USBs does the laptop come with a USB dongle thing ? 
The pad is complete trash for sure that is my only complain and why i got a surface book instead 
lol the testing of the keyboard text is funny 
I really dont know wtf you are talking about when you say the 15in battery is not as good. Many many battery tests out there proved that the 15in actually has a decently longer battery life over the 13in. 
The Verge T-shirt. ?? 
Thinner MacBookPro are for the weak 
I think apple needs to be careful and make a difference between being innovative and pathetic. 
i hate that they put all the fn buttons on a touch bar. definently not a laptop id buy. 
How many hours on battery life? 
So jealous 
nice camera

Do you think that apple will release a new macbook pro next year or update it just fixing some issues and adding some new things? 
Just bought my MacBook Pro 13 yesterday... my first Macbook ever and I cant complain 
Can anyone recommend a good laptop for a writer? 
iPhones need to move from lightning to usb c. It needs to be the same across the platform. 
Yawn  another over priced apple product.....moving along. 
Thanks for cutting through the noise and providing a balanced and informative review. It was sorely needed. 
Hi marques ur review was fab My only question is can I use it as gaming laptop 
Your amazing 
some windows fanboys are so stupid. they think apple payed them because he said something good about it 
Where the hell is yr great intro Marques? 
can we get an updated review 
Is MKBHD worth it?

Early squad gather here. 
How about mentioning it has 4 thunderbolt 3 ports and expanding on its many functionalities? 
Is your PSN MKBH? If so we were playing call of duty together 
how about keyboard touchscreen? that would be cool... 
will you be reviewing the samsung chromebook plus and pro? 
Clean your keyboard jaja please xd 
your hands are creepy  big... 
Anyone know the band MKBHD wears. 
Ive been using the MacBook Pro for a while and I found out you can skip ads with the touchbar...

good job tackling about the usb-c thingy hopefully everything will have usb-c ports in the future 
another paid review 
amazing review 
The macbook airs still have glowing logos 
Why u dont upload videos in 60fps????? 
i think your overselling the touchbar just a little bit 
For the same price as the new Razer Blade Pro, you can get a laptop that is a few milimeters thinner, and offers practically none of the connectivity and a fourth of the performance if at all. It truly must take courage to sell a product like that.\n\nHow they could even brand a device with basically netbook tier specs complete with the lack of I/O and one which also tops off at 16GB of RAM and a LOW END GPU and lacks ALL of the connectivity a pro user would use all the time   Pro   is beyond me.  
I wish I had the money for this for school 
I have enough money but its toooooooooo expensive 
The Matrix glitches at 856   lol 
I can accept all the changes but why the f would you kill Magsafe ? One of the best inventions for laptops
Its fukin expensive doe 
where my mbp 2011 users at 
Just the best reviewer on the game efficient af 
Ayyy my man MKBHD back with another HD video 
Do these MacBook Pros have expandable hard drives? 
wait.... NO DVD DRIVE ON THIS??? 
Who cares about an SD port to the average user 
Could you do surface book 2016 review?? 
Carbon fibre is plastic and to me it is more premium than aluminium. 
I miss the glowing thing lol 
854 what in the world was that effect lol im gonna be sick 
Not worth it Thanks for the video 
Marques complains about 4 usb c ports where I have only 2 
why are the docks and stuff slightly darker than my MacBook? what setting did he use? 
WOW this guy is cute <3 
2016 is getting over and I am still waiting for the full review of iPhone 7 
I still think its absolute shit tho... i cant handle carrying all those dongles / what was the purpose of making them ligther then ? 
surface book pro is a much better device 
+marques brownlee \nI really like your videos there very easy to understand 
very useful info. Thanks 
I would have bought this but the price is just too high 
You are the average person 
So thunderbolt is already toast...
His MacBook looks small. Is it the 13 inch or the 15 inch model? does anyone know? 
I think Apple should hire this guy. What a great review. 
Macs are not worth it. 
LMAOOO KANYE 
Marques do you use final cut for editing and after effects for graphics? 
Would you think the whole design might be a bit more ergonomic if the display bar was right above the trackpad? 
856 Look at the upper right o.o 
That laptop is trash. 
How dare they get rid of MagSafe That was my favorite feature in MBs 
Wow... Super Touchbar 
I will buy this thing just to rewind Instagram videos lmao 
if your willing to pay for it like most apple sheep then its not overpriced 
can you do a macbook pro give away 
I wish you talked more about the battery life. 
I brought it and it is the best 1300$ I have ever spent 
Love your videos thank you for keeping me updated 
i still have a 2011 macbook air haha 
Its expensive again but I love Mac but never use  Mac OS. 
856-857...what just happened? 
excellent review 
Can this handle editing 4K video at 30 and 60fps? 
I finally can see myself buying a mac-book pro 
Looks like a touch screen... WHEN ARE THEY GONNA ADD TOUCH SCREEN 
This guy has huge hands.. dare I ask? 
Yea just support apple and the ridiculous things they are doing. I thought your reviews were different but I guess not. Another rich YouTuber supporting this bullshit laptop. 
Did you correct for lense distortion at 856 ? 
I miss these good old dope intros and orgasm-inducing shots man 
Why are there dislikes this review was really good 
Can you do an update about the touchbar support? 
Im more interested in his shirt than the MacBook pro 
Nice review bro 
Is he wearing a Verge t-shirt? 
This or Huawei matebook x pro? 
Should i get the late 2017 model at this point or hold out for that 2018? 
is the iphone 8 going to have a USB-C then? 
Id personally would just get a control surface instead of a touchbar 
Old mac hdmi ssd usb mag safe light logocheaper than the new one.\nNew mac 4 usb c ports. Very exspensive. Touch bar that noone wanted.\nSo if i had the money yes however i prefer the old one to this as it has more external features 
would be better placed under the spacebar where is more easily accessed. 
nice. I know touch bar but I want touch on screen  
Nope MacBook Air still has the glowing apple 
One of the nice video Can I borrow this? Haha lol  
I LIVE for your reviews Love your work and honesty. 
pay really close attention on the table at @850 
i hope i will never ever see someone using that machine in rl 
review hp pavilion pls 
Nice review. 
Great Gesture of Scrubing 
would you rather get a applewagch or ipadpro 
2K dislikes are from other tech reviewers who copy him anyway...do your thing M 
What Laptop do you use Marques ? 
The specs on the 13 inch model are a joke 
Would you recommend the 13 or 15 inch? Any one please answer 
and then I was like woah that expensive 
Wtf? The escape key is no longer physical? 
i\xe2\x80\x99m getting that for my bday 
What if you plug in 4 chargers at the same time 
that west part was nice touch.. lol 
Stupid overpriced laptop 
Woah that shift in the corners at 855 
Extremely well spoken. Nice video. 
laptop is a flop 
is laptop better or computer better for gaming and youtuber 
I love this review 
is it overpriced? Yes. Would I still buy it? Yes. 
041 Remind me the famous ... My name is Boxxy 
Half of the video was wasted talking about touch bar only. The best feature of MacBook Pro is just a gimmick. 
Hey where did you get the adaptors? 
Thanks for video 
MKBHD took his first L with this video 
your advert came on 
Macbook or Gigabyte Aero 15x? What do you guys? 
You can play Quake on it. 
marques how you grow taller 
marcus brownlee so rich that he could afford this
MKBHD is becoming an apple fanboy and EverythingApplePro is becoming an Android fanboy 
I have one 
Clearly paid 
Thanks for your realistic and smart comments 
Wow this is soo smart.... liked the way you reviewed it  
this thing looks good for editing 
Wallpaper in video? 
when will the next gen macbook pros come out? 
Wow 
Was I the only one who tried CTRL T when he said it 
what camera do you use 
Happy 6M 
If you are reading this.  Hope you are having An Amazing Day/Night. 
Apple are amazing scam artists 
Someone gift me this. 
What camra do you use its good 
should i change from my late 2011 to 2016? 
_2015 MacBook pro FTW_ 
I have the 15 inch one 
Who can buy a red camera? We are mortals 
as always. too expensive. 
Great review.  Everything I wanted to know.  Keep it up 
I still have my 2012 MacBook Pro and it still works. 
Thanks Marques 
Is any Apple product worth it ?\n\nShort answer  NO 
Catholic expensive debate same kiss label field. 
Excellent Thank you. 
What headphones are those 
Mag-Safe can still be implemented in the design by incorporating a Mag-connection between the Usb-C connector and the power cord. If Apple wants it...I dont know... 
never apple. never. 
I just ordered it now 
I had to revisit the past 
Are you being paid by Apple? This looks like a pretty horrible computer and you sound rather disingenuous. 
shameless snap plug 
I just marvel in the honesty of your reviews keep up the great work mate 
great job 
Ff 
i feel like apple is paying you to be nice about this garbage 
please make a video about acer swift 3, 5, 7  
This uncle Tom is paid by APPLE. 
I bought the maxed out versionThank you marques 
next gen is usb-D 
Wanna here a joke? ... Dongles. 
Now I want a desktop touch bar That would be awesome 
who won the shoes? 
nice 
How did this come to be 
I SPOT A SKYPANEL 
A different animal but the same beast. Lmao neega what? 
laptop giveaways please\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d 
Someone used the flow transition in final cut at 856 
1856 tripped me out 
When macbook 12 is going to be realized? 
No. Saved you 11 minutes. 
Looks nice 
His shirt was giving me OCD. 
So no normal usb? 
Love the honesty from Marques. \n\nI think that is some great reviewing. 
thats so cool 
You should so do more laptop reviews. 
wtf does that mean Kobe Bryant 
Did he say QUICK TIME Player??? -D That nonsense still exist?? -D 
Any ETA for the camera review? 
hate the ports 
Review the ticwatch 
Is it 4k 
I wish the logo still lit up. 
Why no review of the 2017? 
I brought one but was thinking should have got 13inch but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have quard core. 
Love youu <3 love your reviews 
Hey man Nice video Cool lenses 
Why do you have 2K dislikes??? well at least you have 20k more like and 5K comments. love all ur reviews

So classy from start to finish. Love u bro 
waiting for a review of this laptop from a software developer 
wearing a verge shirt and giving us a verge like crap 
you seem changed...dafuk? 
Ending with Peace ? Or Piece? Is Marquees on drug like Hash? Chilling? \nA clear NONO. 
100% proof that you are a sell out MKBHD The old Marques would have grilled Apple for removing mag safe but keeping the headphone jack which they removed from the iphone.\nI guess you have to pay for your new Tesla somehow. Sorry mate but you are not my favorite Tech guy but not any more. 
Warghhh Give me the oneplus 3T please 
The SSD is soldered to the board on these new macbooks. Have fun replacing the whole logic board when your ssd goes bad. Have fun getting your data back when the logic board goes bad. 
So the reason apple sells these things on so high price is bcuz not so average person like you will buy it anyway i got it alright lol 
Please share a review on newly launched Motorola Moto M India edition thank you. 
mkbhd you are the boss of all tech reviewer ...... 
waiting for smartphone awards 2016 
Am I the only one blocked on this dust on your right shoulder? High resolution comes  with the price o 
Apple fan boy 
Yay more people that agree that touch screen laptops are not good or necessary 
whew this comment section is absolute trash. 
love your channel mkbhd 
my whole family watches your videos 
345 \nto the right of the plant\nsums up why to not get this laptop \nlike if u agree xD 
hey Marcus what does the K stands for in your name

CRAP  old technology  
was waiting for u to do a review on the macbook 
Secure color mandate ship dog modern rebel regular. 
Hahahahahaha Marques you are never ever allowed to say too many nice things about anything Apple ....good luck buddy. 
Care blind introduce solar. 
please do a video on bluetooth 5 
Lol that moment when you realize that the track pad is 1/3 the size of the keyboard. 
Worth it? No of course not. 
Nice 
they took the pro out of MacBook pro 
Worth it 
e kaa he be 
No 
I want that t-shirt bro lol 
Apple 
@ 849 ...that angle ~.~ 
how do you connect a projector ? 
cool 
Stop cursing 
They should make the touch bar a little bigger 
Ultra overpriced POS built for Cunts. 
No. 
Just get a pc and get a virtual machine 
Whats on his wrist? 
T shirt? 
hey how is the final cut pro 4k editing performance? 
NOT 
What was that intro 
Any idea for when new 2017 model mackbook air comes??? Any one ans me 
nice bro 
verge?? P 
DAT VERGE T-SHIRT 
Helpful information. Thank you  
Sell out 
The quality is superb and it is good for me not an avg person to think about the price. 
It took me 6mins in to realize he had on a Verge shirt. 
there is no way apple could possible say that adding a SD card slot would not fit.\n\nthey literally take up no room on the motherboard AT ALL. 
I am a apple bot.I will buy this regardless...pi bo pip bo 
Not worth it for all the lost features. More was taken away than added. 
As much as a Mac Book fanboy MKBHD is, I respect the fact he can still say he does not recommend it to the typical person. AKA if you are not wealthy, do not buy it lol  
Is this laptop worth it? Short answer No Long answer No Way 
Is that a verge logo on his chest wtf? 
you were in YouTube Rewind 2016 
sponsored by apple 
RIP Apple 
Am I the only one asking Mr. MKBHD for the iPhone 7 review Come on man 
The 2015 Macbook Pro with the Retina Display is way more powerful and useful. Don\ t but this laptop.It\ s a trap
I saw you in youtube rewind. It was my favorite part  
What happened to the intro music?? 
Crossing the bridge is fine to USB Type C but getting rid of every other port is trash. Adapters are trash when you dont have to get rid of everything. 
i want Facial Recognition like windows hello 
where is iphone 7 review brother Marques ...... I am waiting for that....plz reply 
the conspiracy lol 
Review HP and Dell notebook later? 
4 mill subs bruh better gimme that Mac book  
Should still have an SD card slot 
got a surface pro 4 ad before this video 
Is it worth the price ....NO lol I waited the whole video for you to say that. 
Apple went to Space  
I absolutely love his honesty on this Macbook Pro. Also god help us all in the next four years. - 
I expect better from you Marques. 
is it verge logo on your shirt 
Wait it has a headphone jack wtf ?? 
When will you review iphone 7??? 
No. I answered your question. 
The TrackPad It To Dam Big 
He says inconvenient 
MacBook Pro baby 
Is this a review or a promo? 
Where is the iPhone 7 review? 
Are you finding 16 gigs of ram to be a limiting factor? 
What did he mean by skipping the 2016 model and wait for 2017? Will it get a new fresh next year? 
No 4k option for that video ? 
lol @ the dongles 
I Love The Design Of The MacBook Pro 
No 
Your Best Review Till now  <3 
Eloquent and concise as always 
I love mine 
is that a verge shirt ? 
Hi 
Marques Brownlee I see that new J. Cole album... 
856 WTF?? 
This episode was brought to you by apple. 
Good review  
Gimmick. touch is lame. 
I like the Quote on quote pro P 
HOW IS YOUR VIDEO SO CRISP AND SHARP What camera are you using? im in love with the quality subscribed forever. just wow 
No. 
you sell out 
reminds me of his old videos with beats headphones...such a sheep 
If I wanted a computer with a touch screen I would buy an HP 
I hate touchscreen laptop too 
Marquees seems like a bit confused for giving a confident answer for the first time....true? 
Thumbs up for The Verge t-shirt 
Unsubbed. Meh 
damn do you actually edit RED footage on this MacBook Pro? 
Yet another crappy thing about 2016 - Marques Brownlee sold out 
Too bad the batery is crap  
omg it is not the first laptop with fingerprint scanner 
What about buying a notebook today ? \n\nI think 13 inch non touch bar is worth the money compared to 12 macbook ?\n\nI want to upgrade from a Macbook air 2013. 
The old ones goes up in price Do they have the HQ cpu with 35-45W or the boring regular ones as they in most PC? 
they should have made the touchbar have 3d touch 
I want The thicker one with all The ports and battery life 
Get an ultrabook and install OS on it. NEVER BUY A MACBOOK. 
146 why would you fake your typing? notice the last dot comes delayed without a button pressed. 
I just wish I could buy it with windows 10 installed 
the macbook air that they still sell has a glowing apple logo 
no thunderbolt 3??? Aw... Huge letdown... 
is it also possible to have usb type c ethernet port??? 
Check out Snazzy Labs I think its a more Realistic Review instead of a personalized review just my opinion 
Cant believe ur actually in the youtube rewind 
i like the razor blade 
you are the best tech reviewer I want to be just like you 
Last years MacBook pro looks a lot better than that one especially in that boring colour 
laughter space by departure multiple lawsuit draft. 
Speakers being cosmetic? Have you tried covering the up and compared the sound? -\nGreat review as always though 
Verry nice 
like the unbiased review 
Honest Review @MKBHD 
Do ask MKBHD V12 
Can I applaud this guy??? He used the Kobe Joke appropriately......yessss 
You can also skip Youtube Ads with the touch bar 
This Is Number 17 In Trending Videos \nGood Job Marques 
No 
I really need a laptop.  
856 loo at the top right corner Wtf is that? 
NOT WORTH IT 
Battery life? Just ordered mine 2.6/512/460 
Crispy af 
Best review of this yet. 
no 
sick 
peace  
Hold it. Where can I get that white iPhone skin...? 
I need a new laptop for school since mine is getting really old and sputtery right now so should I buy the new MacBook or the previous version? 
Thanks for your paid review .....and nice attempt to convince us to buy this donglebook pro.\nKeep it up eating apple 
when will the MacBook air come out ? 
Biased review and no disclosures announced. 
Why are you wearing a Verge shirt??? 
first video i disliked of mkbhd. 
Sick review as always 
Totally biased. 
my first dislike of MKBHD since I have subscribed.... you have lost my respect MKBHD  
looks like a paid video 
will still sell for videographers and editors. fcpx blows premiere and Adobe updates always are better for Mac OS. 
fashion accessory. 
Its so cool..\nSomebody please gift me one ^_^ D 
its trending #19 nice. 
I always watch your videos even though I have no intention of buying most of the products. I have never owned a Macbook in my life and never intend to. But I thoroughly enjoyed the video 
I would honestly be more irritated about not having an SD card reader than not having traditional USB ports... 
Does anyone know how well it runs when mixing large music projects? And if the touch bar helps that process in any way? 
YES THE Kobe/Kanye commercial was an awesome reference.  I say that all the time and only the cool kids will get it lol 
Reminds me of Bad boys. \n\nYou got a $80k car and no cup holder?\n\nYou got a $4k laptop and no USB 3? 
marques brownlee... I love your videos.. how did you start? 
Super expensive shit.... 
In the future there will be USB z and all you will be needing. USB c adaptors. A never ending world of dongles. 
Whats on my smartphone once again 
how do I make a logo like yours 
Adding New Ports is an Innovation but Removing old ports and forcing people to spend on expensive adaptors is business.. 
Marquees should help design apple products cause his opinions are logical. 
Hahaha Marques what was up with that Kanye bit? 
how much did apple people pay you for good review 
Should of just called it MacBook because there is nothing pro about it 
311 A retina screen nightmare Why did you touch it D 
let me save you 11 minutes.. its not worth it 
How can you fix black screen in GS5 
Always watch your videos without scrubbing around. 
Its just too overpriced. btw nice video mkbhd 
Great review 
why theres no music? 
But Macbook pro is not for me 
Finally bro U did it \nWas waitin for you to do it 
That Kanye clip tho 
Best review of the 2016 MacBook Pro 
i liked it 
I see that u like j.cole 
Nothing from Mac is worth it. TOSS IT IN THE TRASH 
Like the honesty  
The Verge t-shirt looks lit 
Cool 
Why are you wearing Verge logo shirt? 
that is one sexy laptop. 
Stupid Apple. At least let us upgrade the drives. 
For Computer Science degree will a 13 inch with 512 gbs and 16gb ram good? 
will you do the Dell xps 15? 
Is this the Space Grey variant? I cant seem to figure out what color it is... 
Isnt usb type c on every android phone 
what does he use to edit his vids 
Trump can fit both his hands on the track pad 
WTF is happening with the table at 856? 
wearing a verge t-shirt and praising an overpriced apple product. 
plz make a video on Dell xps 15 
Awesome  
great vid 
Fanboy 
You are wearing Verge T-shirt. meaning? 
why make such a big trackpad? 
i still think it would have been cooler if Apple had made a separate beautifully designed  TouchBar device and a new innovation and included a touchscreen on the new MacBook Pro 
The lighter body of the laptop is countered with the weight of all the dongles / 
I love how apple is literally extorting everyone for more money by only including USB type C ports so you have to spend more money buying adapters but because most reviewers love apple everyone is cool with it. 
Apple fan boy.Rediculous slider and insanely useless touchpad 
i hate the new mousepad and keyboard. The touch bar ruins the keyboard too because the escape key is the the touch bar now  
Gotta badass ports just bouncing on my Mac\nBouncing on my Mac\nJust bouncing on my Mac 
Sorry to burn your hype train\nBut I think Surface dial on Surface Book can get shortcut much faster than touchbar 
The touchbar is a gimmick. Dongles are a disgrace. At least add ore outlets if you are going all in on the USB-C standard.\n\nNot being able to connect the latest iPhone to the latest Mac = an absolute shambles.\n\nSpend your money elsewhere. 
this thing cost over 4500 $ just buy the surface studio my god its more better 
Away answer market inspector call knock touch onto less. 
you should use some background music because the video gets boring 
Booooring 
Amazing video and finaly with no ECHO How did you do it? 
first 5 minutes is like paid promotion video. 
Watching on my 2015 Macbook Pro. Still satisfied. Great video though. 
yeh mkbhd are you doing international giveaway of google pixel xl again bcse i miss old one and get chance to win it as i cant afford it now .. 
I would love a video that compares this to Razor version with the toughest at the side 
I think there is no reason to remove the SD card reader 
Does anyone else do the peace sign back when he end the videos? 
Can be a Wifi enabled camera can solve the SD card slot problem? 
The touchbar looks 3x nicer in person. But its not worth the extra cost. Almost nothing this laptop does justifies its price tag. 
SD card slot & Headphone Jack will survive in the future with or without Apple. 
Random comment to support mkbhd because of stupid algorithm change. 
I hope you can ship me a mac so I can learn to code. 
How dis they get you to dance on the youtube rewind 
I think the 2014 edition is the most port friendly and still has good performance 
my gripe is the loss of the SD card as well. Why Apple? 
Can some company keep AMOLED in laptops already? 
Bags of dongles are real. 
hi bro you dance pretty well see you dancing for a couple of sec in you tube rewind 2016 \ncongratulation for hitting the  4000000  mark 
that verge t-shirt is cool
Supposed to be playing the game of war but this one player keeps kicking my ass... 
Hey MKB, This laptop is good for android developer...  
verge logo on your tee 
344 those adapters tho 
why r u wearing a verge t shirt 
When did the air become the pro? 
wooo Verge T-shirt 
Smoothest videos on youtube no doubt love this dude 
that upshot was super dope 
Hay in 618 did you switch from your m50x

Loving the honest review 
This one player keeps kicking my ass. 
Thanks for your honest review  
Can you do a full Amazon echo review?
