### R
  ...for quick reference

#### Getting Started

This ![link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-18-04) helped me install <strong>R</strong> in Ubuntu.

<strong>Installing R packages from CRAN</strong>

		install.packages('txtplot')
		library('txtplot')

where `txtplot` is a library that outputs ASCII graphs that include scatterplot, line plot, density plot, acf and bar charts.

#### TIP

To install packages to all users, use 
	``sudo -i R``
